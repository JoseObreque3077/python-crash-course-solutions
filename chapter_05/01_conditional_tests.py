# Exercise 5-1
# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing
# each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should
# look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand
# why each line evaluates to True or False.
# Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True
# and another five tests evaluate to False.

print(f"Is 5 < 15 ? Answer: {5 < 15}")
print(f"Is 10 = 10 ? Answer: {10 == 10}")
print(f"Is 2 + 22 <= 30 ? Answer: {2 + 22 <= 30}")
print(f"Is 'a' in 'america' ? Answer: {'a' in 'america'}")
print(f"Is 25 in [10, 15, 20, 25] ? Answer: {25 in [10, 15, 20, 25]}")

print(f"Is 50 <= 15 ? Answer: {50 <= 15}")
print(f"Is 10 = 20 ? Answer: {10 == 20}")
print(f"Is 5 + 32 <= 30 ? Answer: {5 + 32 <= 30}")
print(f"Is 'w' in 'peru' ? Answer: {'w' in 'peru'}")
print(f"Is 125 in [10, 15, 20, 25] ? Answer: {125 in [10, 15, 20, 25]}")
