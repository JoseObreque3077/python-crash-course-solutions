# Exercice 5-2
# More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create
# to ten. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them to
# conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of
# the following:
# - Tests for equality and inequality with strings
# - Tests using the lower() method
# - Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater
#   than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or
#   equal to
# - Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
# - Test whether an item is in a list
# - Test whether an item is not in a list
