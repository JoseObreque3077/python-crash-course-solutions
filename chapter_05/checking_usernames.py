# Exercise 5-10
# Do the following to create a program that simulates how
# websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
# - Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
# - Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make
#   sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the
#   current_users list.
# - Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username
#   has already been used. If it has, print a message that the
#   person will need to enter a new username. If a username has
#   not been used, print a message saying that the username is
#   available.
# - Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has
#   been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, youâ€™ll
#   need to make a copy of current_users containing the lowercase
#   versions of all existing users.)

current_users = ["JOHNCONNOR", "WarMachine97", "tomcat", "MontyBurns", "MrX"]
new_users = ["WARMachine97", "JohnHammond", "ELOHIM", "TomCat", "MScott"]

current_users_lowercase = [user.lower() for user in current_users]

for new_user in new_users:
    if new_user.lower() in current_users_lowercase:
        print("Sorry, you will need to enter another username")
    else:
        print("The username is available")
