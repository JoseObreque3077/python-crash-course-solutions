# Exercise 6-2
# Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of
# five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite
# number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary.
# Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a
# few friends and get some actual data for your program.

favorite_numbers = {
    "Anthony": 7,
    "Scott": 11,
    "Steve": 4,
    "Natasha": 13,
    "Jennifer": 32
}

print(f"Anthony's favorite number is {favorite_numbers['Anthony']}")
print(f"Scott's favorite number is {favorite_numbers['Scott']}")
print(f"Steve's favorite number is {favorite_numbers['Steve']}")
print(f"Natasha's favorite number is {favorite_numbers['Natasha']}")
print(f"Jennifer's favorite number is {favorite_numbers['Jennifer']}")
