# Exercise 6-9
# Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names
# to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for
# each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends
# to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and
# print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
