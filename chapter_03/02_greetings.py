# Exercise 3-2:
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing
# each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the
# same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["Anthony", "Bruce", "Peter"]
print(f"Hi {names[0]}, have a nice day!")
print(f"Hi {names[1]}, have a nice day!")
print(f"Hi {names[2]}, have a nice day!")
