# Exercise 3-3:
# Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a
# motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
# to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda
# motorcycle.”

vehicles = ["car", "motorcycle", "bicycle"]
print(f"I would like to own a Tesla {vehicles[0]}.")
print(f"I love Harley Davidson {vehicles[1]}s design.")
print(f"I would like to own a {vehicles[2]} with a carbon frame.")
