# you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to
# invite to dinner.
# Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

guests = ["Natasha", "Scott", "Peter"]
print(f"{guests[0]}, I invite you to dinner.")
print(f"{guests[1]}, I invite you to dinner.")
print(f"{guests[2]}, I invite you to dinner.")
