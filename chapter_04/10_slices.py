# Exercise 4-10:
# Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several lines to
# the end of the program that do the following:
#
# Print the message The first three items in the list are:. Then use a
# slice to print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.
#
# Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use
# a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
#
# Print the message The last three items in the list are:. Use a slice
# to print the last three items in the list.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using the code from exercise 4-6:
odd_numbers = list(range(1, 21, 2))

for number in odd_numbers:
    print(number)

print(f"The three first elements in the array are: {odd_numbers[:3]}")
print(f"Three items from the middle of the list are: {odd_numbers[3:6]}")
print(f"The last three items in the list are: {odd_numbers[-3:]}")
