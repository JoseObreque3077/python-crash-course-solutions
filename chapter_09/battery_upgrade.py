"""
Exercise 9-9

Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section. Add a
method to the Battery class called upgrade_battery(). This method should check
the battery size and set the capacity to 100 if it isn't already.
Make an electric car with a default battery size, call get_range() once, and
then call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see
an increase in the car's range.
