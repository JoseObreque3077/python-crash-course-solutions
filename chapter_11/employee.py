"""
Exercise 11-3

Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take
in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes.

Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the annual salary
by default but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods,
test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise().

Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
