# Exercise 2-7: 
# Use a variable to represent a personâ€™s name, and include some
# whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
# character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the
# name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

name = "\tSherlock Holmes\t\n"
print(name)
print(name.lstrip())
print(name.rstrip())
print(name.strip())
