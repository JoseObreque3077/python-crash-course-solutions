"""
Exercise 10-13

The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the user
has already entered their username or that the program is running for the
first time. We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who
last used the program. Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(),
ask the user if this is the correct username. If itâ€™s not, call
get_new_username() to get the correct username.
